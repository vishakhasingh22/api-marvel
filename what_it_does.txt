This project is a simple web application that allows users to search for Marvel characters using the Marvel API. Here's a breakdown of what the project does:

HTML Structure:
The HTML file (index.html) consists of:
An input field where users can type the name of a Marvel character.
A submit button to trigger the character search.
Containers to display the search results.
CSS Styling:
CSS (styles.css) is used to style the HTML elements.
JavaScript Functionality (app.js):
Autocomplete Feature:
As the user types in the input field, the application fetches character names from the Marvel API that match the input using the nameStartsWith parameter.
The matching character names are displayed as suggestions in a dropdown list below the input field.
Fetching Character Data:
When the user clicks on the "Submit" button or presses Enter, the application fetches data for the character whose name is entered in the input field using the Marvel API.
The fetched data includes the character's name, thumbnail image, and description.
Displaying Character Information:
The fetched character data is displayed in a card format showing the character's image, name, and description.
Marvel API Integration:
The application integrates with the Marvel API to fetch character data.
It uses a timestamp, a public key, a private key, and an MD5 hash value for authentication to access the Marvel API.
Structure of Marvel API URLs:
Character Autocomplete URL: https://gateway.marvel.com:443/v1/public/characters?ts=${timestamp}&apikey=${apiKey}&hash=${hashValue}&nameStartsWith=${input.value}
Character Data URL: https://gateway.marvel.com:443/v1/public/characters?ts=${timestamp}&apikey=${apiKey}&hash=${hashValue}&name=${input.value}
Marvel API Authentication:
Timestamp (ts): A timestamp is generated and used as part of the authentication process.
Public Key (publicKey): The public API key provided by Marvel.
Private Key (privateKey): The private API key provided by Marvel.
Hash Value (hashVal): An MD5 hash generated using a combination of timestamp, private key, and public key.
